Thank you for trying colo,

here's what you need to do to use it:

edit colo.c and change these lines:

#define XTERM "/usr/X11R6/bin/xterm"
#define DEFAULT_COLORC "/usr/local/lib/colorc"

the first should be set to wherever xterm is on your system (you can find this
by typing 'which xterm' at your prompt)

the next should be set to the path to a file to use for a default color file
when no other is found.. (it searches for a .colorc in your home directory)

then compile colo with something like:
  cc -o colo colo.c
or
  gcc -o colo colo.c

after that, you should set up a .colorc in your home directory, a way to start
is probably copy the colorc included in this archive, and edit it to your
liking..

colors are picked from any line in the file except the first one, and the lines
contain

foreground-color,background-color,(cursor-color)

where cursor-color can be omitid if you just want it to be the same as
foreground-color

enjoy!
